Executing:
> make
... generates an executable "simlight", which is a simple simulator for ARMv6.

The simulator "simlight" is untimed, mono-threaded, without any
peripheral. There are no MMU nor Coprocessors. The memory starts at address 4
and its size is 1 MB.

Executing:
> ./simlight
... displays the available options.

Recommended compilation command when compiled from emacs:
cd /path/to/simsoc-cert/simlight2 && make && cd ../test && ./check2


Known bugs and possible improvements:

- [done] many instruction types in slv6_iss.h are identical. Thus, the generated code
  could be shortened.

- [BUG] some instructions (such as LDR) modifies the T flag after modifying the
  PC. Because setting the PC depends on T, the branch target can be erroneously
  4 bytes before or 4 bytes after.

- the sequential algorithm of the decoder is slow. It could be improved by a
  "switch" based decoder.

- more specialization may improve performance: S bit, L bit, W bit, condition
  for B, etc.

- searching sub-expressions that can be computed at decode time is currently done 
  fully by hand. An automatic analyzer would be helpful.
