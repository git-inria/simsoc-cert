PREREQUISITES:

* OCaml 3.12.0 available from http://caml.inria.fr/ .

* Coq 8.3pl1 available from http://coq.inria.fr/ .

* The sources of Compcert 1.8.1 available from
  http://compcert.inria.fr/ .

* All the prerequisites required for CompCert, described in 
  compcert-1.8.1/README.

* The compilation of CompCert done with Coq 8.3pl1 as described in
  compcert-1.8.1/README.

* For ARM tests, a binary called 'arm-elf-gcc' need to be accessible
  from the path. This binary can be found for example inside the

--------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILATION OF THE MAIN TOOL:

1- Configure the system:

             ./configure -compcert-dir <path>

   where <path> is the directory where the sources of CompCert are.
   This creates a symbolic link named 'compcert' in the top directory.

2- Compile the main program:

             make

   This creates the 'simgen' program in the 'pseudocode' directory. Do
   'simgen -h' to get the list of the options. Read 'README.simgen'
   for more details.
