SimSoC-Cert, a toolkit for generating certified processor simulators

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES:

* The sources of the CompCert compiler, version 1.8.1, available from
  http://compcert.inria.fr/ .

* All the prerequisites required for CompCert, described in 
  compcert-1.8.1/README.

* The compilation of CompCert done. See compcert-1.8.1/README.

* For ARM tests, a binary called 'arm-elf-gcc' need to be accessible
  from the path. This binary can be found for example inside the
  SimSoC project (see http://formes.asia/cms/software/simsoc).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILATION OF THE MAIN TOOL:

1- Configure the system:

             ./configure -compcert-dir <path>

   where <path> is the directory where the sources of CompCert are.
   This creates a symbolic link named 'compcert' in the top directory.

2- Compile the main program:

             make

   This creates the 'simgen' program in the top directory. Do 'psgen
   -h' to get the list of the options. Read 'README.simgen' for more
   details.

0- Remove all generated files:

             make clean
