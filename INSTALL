SimSoC-Cert, a toolkit for generating certified processor simulators
--------------------------------------------------------------------


PREREQUISITES

* The CompCert compiler, version 1.8.1.
  It is available from http://compcert.inria.fr/download.html

* All the prerequisites required for CompCert, described in 
  compcert-1.8.1/README.

* The compilation of CompCert done, inside compcert-1.8.1 :

             ./configure <target> && make proof extraction

    where <target> is described in compcert-1.8.1/README

* For ARM tests, a binary called 'arm-elf-gcc' need to be accessible from the 
  path.
  This binary can be found for example inside the SimSoC project.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

             We assume that all the following operations are done at the top
             directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


INSTALLATION

1- Configure the system.

             ./configure -compcert-dir <path>

   where <path> is the directory where CompCert is.
   This creates a symbolic link named 'compcert' inside the top directory.

?- An alternative, and faster approach to steps 2 to 5 is

             make all

   Here comes the steps 2 to 5.

2- Compile the pseudo-code generator.

             make

   This compiles all the Coq sources, extracts them extract/tmp, and compiles
   all the OCaml sources needed to obtain the generator from ARM6 and SH4.

3- Convert the PDF manual into several COQ files by using the generator.

             make arm6 sh4

   This transforms 
     arm6.pdf  into  arm6inst.v + arm6dec.v  ,
      sh4.pdf  into   sh4inst.v +  sh4dec.v  .

4- Add the COQ manual to the simulator project.

             make extract

   The simulator and some remaining Coq sources are extracted in extract/tmp.

5- Compile the whole simulator with what is necessary to test it.

             make test

   For each C file in the directory 'test', we generate an OCaml file inside
   'extract/tmp', to run as input with the simulator.
   Note that this step takes 10 minutes or so on a recent machine.

0- Clean to project.

             make clean

   An alternative, and cleaner approach is [make clean-all] which do a 
   [make clean] following by a [make clean] on [arm6 sh4 extract test].


--------------------------------------------------------------------


USAGE

* To launch the tests for ARM.

             ./test/debug

  The tests appearing in test/debug.ml are run with the simulator, which outputs
  the name of the program being tested, following by OK if the result is what it
  is expected.
