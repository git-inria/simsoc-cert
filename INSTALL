SimSoC-Cert, a toolkit for generating certified processor simulators
See the COPYRIGHTS and LICENSE files

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:

* OCaml 3.12.0 available from http://caml.inria.fr/ .

* Coq 8.3pl1 available from http://coq.inria.fr/ .

* The sources of Compcert 1.8.1 available from
  http://compcert.inria.fr/ .

* All the prerequisites required for CompCert, described in 
  compcert-1.8.1/README.

* The compilation of CompCert done with Coq 8.3pl1 as described in
  compcert-1.8.1/README.

* For ARM tests, a binary called 'arm-elf-gcc' need to be accessible
  from the path. This binary can be found for example inside the
  SimSoC project (http://formes.asia/cms/software/simsoc).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation of Simgen:

1) Configure the system:

      ./configure -compcert-dir <path>

   where <path> is the directory where the sources of CompCert are.
   This creates a symbolic link named 'compcert' in the top directory.

2) Compile Simgen:

      cd simgen; make

   This creates a program 'simgen/main'. Do 'simgen/main -h' to get
   the list of options. Read 'README.simgen' for more details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Generation and compilation of simulators using Simgen:

C simulators:
      cd arm6/simlight; make
      cd arm6/simlight2; make

Read arm6/simlight/README and arm6/simlight2/README for more details.

simlight2 is the optimized version of simlight used in SimSoC
(http://formes.asia/cms/software/simsoc).

Run the scripts arm6/test/check-sl and arm6/test/check-sl2 for testing
simlight and simlight2 respectively. This requires an arm-elf-gcc
cross-compiler. See arm6/test/README for more details.

Coq simulators:
      cd arm6/coq; make
      cd sh4/coq; make

OCaml simulators can be extracted from the Coq simulators:
      cd arm6/coq; make extraction
      cd sh4/coq; make extraction

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive reading of Coq files in Emacs with ProofGeneral:

      add the content of ./coqrc to your ~/.coqrc file
