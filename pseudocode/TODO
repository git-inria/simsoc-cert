< add interface files (.mli)

< if there is only one processor, then we can simplify the
   pseudo-code: the local variable processor_id is not useful anymore
   and can be removed (remove calls to ExecutingProcessor and
   occurrences of processor_id: MarkExclusiveGlobal and the like need
   only 2 arguments)

< eliminate todo's in expressions

< add comments

< solve problem occuring with -norm -check

< gencxx: simplify code and remove all TODO's and first-level underscore's

< ast: merge Index and Flag ?

< parser: reduce the number of conflicts in the grammar ?

DONE:
