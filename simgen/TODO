SimSoC-Cert, a toolkit for generating certified processor simulators
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- (re)move target bintest in Makefile

- keep only the really used code in CompCert_Driver.ml . Then we can :
  - suppress the need to read compcert/Makefile.config at each invocation
  - restrict the scope of the directory included in CompCert by default
    (in the "Pathname.define_context")

- add a comment explaining the purpose of lightheadertype and
   syntaxtype

- rename ps2cl_ast_trans.ml into ps2c.ml

- add interface files (.mli)

- if there is only one processor, then we can simplify the
  pseudo-code: the local variable processor_id is not useful anymore
  and can be removed (remove calls to ExecutingProcessor and
  occurrences of processor_id: MarkExclusiveGlobal and the like need
  only 2 arguments)

- eliminate todo's in expressions

- solve problem occuring with -norm -check

- gencxx: simplify code and remove all TODO's and first-level underscore's

- ast: merge Index and Flag ?

- parser: reduce the number of conflicts in the grammar ?

DONE:
