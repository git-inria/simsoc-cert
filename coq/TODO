< avoid repr as much as possible

< use a shift instead of a division by two_power_nat

< define specific more efficient functions for accessing the PC

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:

< replace (m : processor_mode) arguments by a function call
> processor_mode added as an extra field in the state
  requires to preserve some invariant

< fix problem with SignExtend 24/30 (see Claude's mails on 10/01/26)
> done at the OCaml level
