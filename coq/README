SimSoC-Cert, a toolkit for generating certified processor simulators
See the COPYRIGHTS and LICENSE files.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this Coq library (Coq is a proof assistant developped at
INRIA available at http://coq.inria.fr/) is to provide formalizations
of instruction-sets and their semantics for various architectures used
in embedded systems.

Currently, it includes:

1) a formalization of the ARMv6 instruction set semantics:

- Util: useful definitions and functions on integers, lists, etc.
- Bitvec: bit vectors
- Functions: primitives used in the pseudo-code
- Config: module type for implementation defined parameters
- Arm: types and functions for defining the ARM state and semantics

- Proc: processor

- Memory: memory
- SCC: system control coprocessor

- State: global ARM state

- Semantics: semantics of pseudo-code constructions

The library is likely to evolve and include more developments quickly.
