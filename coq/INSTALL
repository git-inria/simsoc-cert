SimSoC-Cert, a Coq library for certifying Systems-on-Chips
----------------------------------------------------------

The compilation procedure that is provided hereafter requires a
UNIX-like operating system with the following commands (it also works
with Cygwin on Windows):

- Coq 8.2pl1 http://coq.inria.fr/
- GNU make version 3.81 http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- GNU find version 4.4.0 http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/findutils.html

For compiling SimSoC-Cert, use the command "MAKE" (replace MAKE by your
command for GNU make).

If you use the development version of SimSoC-Cert under SVN
(http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/simsoc-cert/), after an update,
before doing "MAKE", you need to do 'MAKE config' to recompile
dependencies when new files are added in the archive.

For compiling the html documentation, use the command "MAKE doc". The
starting file is doc/main.html.

For compiling the TAGS file, use the command "MAKE tags". This
requires "coqtags" from ProofGeneral http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/.

For using the library, type the following command in Coq or add it in
your ~/.coqrc file:

	Add Rec LoadPath "<dir>" as SimSoCCert.

where <dir> is the directory where the library is installed.
