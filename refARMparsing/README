Show some problems on the input format. HEre is the output:

           if (not overridden by debug hardware)
                        if ((CV bit of Jazelle OS Control register) == 0) AND
         if Rm == 0
                 if register_list[i] == 1
             if (Rd is even-numbered) and (Rd is not R14) and
             if SignedDoesSat(Rm + SignedSat(Rn*2, 32), 32) or
             if SignedDoesSat(Rm - SignedSat(Rn*2, 32), 32) or
             if SignedDoesSat(Rm[15:0], sat_imm + 1)
                   if register_list[i] == 1
               if (Rd is even-numbered) and (Rd is not R14) and

At least le 2nd (A4.1.11 BXJ) is really problematic, since
it yields 
                        if ((CV bit of Jazelle OS Control register) == 0) AND
                                         begin
                                         (IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED CONDITION) then
                                         end
                             PC = invalidhandler
 

from 
                        if ((CV bit of Jazelle OS Control register) == 0) AND
                                          (IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED CONDITION) then
                              PC = invalidhandler
